# Github Scrum Board

This is really all just me screwing around to learn Backbone.js.

But, it allows you to use any Github repo's issue queue as a SCRUM board.

There is a very simple Express server included.

### To install / test:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shawnrice/gh-scrum-board.git
cd gh-scrum-board
npm install
cd site
bower install
cd ..
node server.js
# Or, if you have gulp, just do:
# gulp
open http://localhost:4711
```
